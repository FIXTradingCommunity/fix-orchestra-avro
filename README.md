# Repository To Avro Tools 

![](FIXorchestraLogo.png)

The repository contains utilities for integration of FIX Orchestra and Apache Avro.

* FIX Orchestra is intended to provide a standard and some reference implementation for machine readable rules of engagement between counterparties. A customisation of the FIX Orchestra specification for a specific Rules of Engagement is know as an "orchestration".

* [Apache Avroâ„¢](https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/index.html) is a data serialization system. One the features it provides is a binary data format that is widely used in [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) integrations. Avro can similarly be used in JMS implementations and other cases. Avro data serialization uses Avro schemas defined in JSON. 

Since FIX version 5.0 there has been a logical distinction between the FIX transport and the Application messages. FIX messages can be exchanged using diverse transports. The generation of Avro Schemas from a FIX Orchestra repository supports cases where Avro is useful or mandated. There are a number of ways in which compatibility between FIX Orchestra and Avro is challenging. These utilities may be useful at a limited scale on a subset of messages.

It is expected that the FIX Orchestra repository will be customised to adapt the schema to the users' specific requirements and to the Avro use case. Without customisation a full FIX ExecutionReport, for example, won't compile : ``` error: code too large```.  Customisation can include the removal of fields associated with the FIX transport (Session).

Additionally at present the FIX Standard Orchestration needs some customisation to work with Java code generation. This is accomplished with a simple ```xslt``` transformation that can be found in the build. Please refer to the FIX Orchestra projects for additional tools.
